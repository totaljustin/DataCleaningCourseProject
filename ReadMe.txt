Description: R program that creates a tidy dataset of means and standard deviations
			 of measurements originally obtained by Smartlab at the Universit√† degli 
			 Studi di Genova. It also creates a second dataset averaging the 
			 measurements in the first file by Subject and Activity. 
			 
Prerequistes: R
			  Internet Connectivity
			  
Outputs: tidy_HCI_HAR_data.csv and average_HCI_HAR_data.csv
			  
Instructions: Place the script run_analysis.R is your working directory. Note that the script 
			  will create several new files and a new subdirectory in this location.
			  
			  Run run_analysis.R
			  
			  The script will download and extract the source dataset. It will then process the
			  data and create the files tidy_HCI_HAR_data.csv and average_HCI_HAR_data.csv in
			  the working directory.
			  
			  Please see CodeBook.md for a description of the files created.
