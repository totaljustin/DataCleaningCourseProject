#Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Analysis

##Study Design

The
input data is provided by Smartlab at the Università degli Studi di Genova. The original dataset
is found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones .

The data used in this analysis originated from the course download site:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

The R script run_analysis.R downloads and processes that data from this URL. 

R program run_analysis.R generates files tidy_HCI_HAR_data.txt and average_HCI_HAR_data.txt in the 
directory from which the script is called.

###tidy_HCI_data.txt
tidy_HCI_data.txt is a space delimited file. The first line contains column headings. The file
contains the mean and standard deviations collected in the original dataset. The measurements have 
been combined with a features dataset that provides measurement labels, a subject dataset containing
identifiers for the study's subjects, and an activity dataset associating the measurements with 
specific activities.

The data in this file are described in the following table

###average_HCI_data.txt
average_HCI_data.txt is a space delimited file. The first line contains column headings. The file
contains the measurements in tidy_HCI_data.txt averaged by Subject, Activity_ID, and Activity.

The data in this file are described in the following table
